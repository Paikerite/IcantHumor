My biggest project that i ever made alone on Blazor based on ASP.NET. There are several mechanics, such as posting, accounts, authentication, autorization, downloading/uploading, OAuth, CRUD operations and etc. 
Made by using different techonlogies like MudBlazor framework, EntityFrameWork core, RESTful Web Api, Swagger, Dependency injection, Newtonsoft.Json, jwt and many other.
DataBase is MS SQL Server
