# IcantHumor
My purpose was create platform for posting funny media content (pictures, gifs, video) that relate with videogames and make reactions (like or dislike).

My biggest project that i ever made alone on Blazor based on ASP.NET. There are several mechanics, such as posting, accounts, authentication, autorization, downloading/uploading, put like or dislike, email confirmation, OAuth, CRUD operations and etc. 
Made by using different techonlogies like MudBlazor framework, Entity Framework Core, RESTful Web Api, Swagger, Dependency injection, Newtonsoft.Json, jwt and many other.
DataBase is MS SQL Server
